# PythPython OOP Assignments


This repository contains beginner-friendly Python programs demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, attributes, methods, constructors, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.



Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! üèóÔ∏è


Description:

Creates a Book class and an EBook subclass.

Shows how to define attributes and methods.

Uses a constructor (__init__) to initialize each object.

Demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism by overriding the read() method in the subclass.



How to Run:

Copy the code from Assignment 1 into a Python file (e.g., book_example.py).

Run the file using Python:

python book_example.py
You‚Äôll see output describing each book and how it is read.



Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge! üé≠


Description:

Demonstrates polymorphism using an Animal base class and subclasses (Dog, Bird, Fish), each with a different move() method.



How to Run:

Copy the code from Activity 2 into a Python file (e.g., animal_polymorphism.py).

Run the file using Python:

python animal_polymorphism.py
You‚Äôll see each animal perform its unique movement.



What You‚Äôll Learn
How to create and use classes in Python.

How to add attributes and methods.

How to use constructors for unique object values.

How inheritance and polymorphism work in OOP.



Requirements
Python 3.x



Feel free to modify the code and try your own ideas!
